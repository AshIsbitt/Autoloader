A short script that opens a list of predefined websites, applications, and file manager locations with the intention of running when you first start up your computer - better suited to laptops, but able to run on desktops too.

Version 1.0 of this script was designed when I was in college, and only worked on windows. This repo hold a completely rewritten version that should work on all operating systems.
